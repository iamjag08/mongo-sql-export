1. run docker compose up -d
2. run mongo as a replica,
docker exec db mongo --eval "
rs.initiate(
  {
    _id : 'rs0',
    members: [
      { _id : 0, host : \"db:27017\" }
    ]
  }
)
"
3. docker exec -it db bash
4. in the shell, type mongo
5. Now we are in mongo shell and we can start creating db and collections

9. db.Books.insertMany([{"ISBN": "9781593279509","AccessionNo": 141220180001,"Title": "A Modern Introduction to Programming","Edition": "Third","subtitle": "A Modern Introduction to Programming","Author": "Marijn Haverbeke","YearOfPublication": "2018","Publisher": "No Starch Press","Pages": 472,"Category": "Java","Price": 300	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279508","AccessionNo": 241220150002,"Title": "Programming In ANSI C","Edition": "Eighth","Author": "E Balaguruswamy","YearOfPublication": "2015","Publisher": "McGraw Hill","Pages": 450,"Category": "C","Price": 600	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279507","AccessionNo": 160420200003,"Title": "Let Us C","Edition": "Seventeenth","Author": "Yashavant Kanetkar ","YearOfPublication": "2020","Publisher": "McGraw Hill","Pages": 600,"Category": "C","Price": 330	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279506","AccessionNo": 200820190004,"Title": "Programming with Java","Edition": "Sixth","Author": "E Balaguruswamy","YearOfPublication": "2019","Publisher": "McGraw Hill","Pages": 600,"Category": "Java","Price": 480	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279505","AccessionNo": 210820170005,"Title": "Fundamentals of Database Systems","Edition": "Sixth","Author": "Elmasri Ramez, Navathe Shamkant","YearOfPublication": "2017","Publisher": "Pearson","Pages": 1100,"Category": "DBMS","Price": 850	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279505","AccessionNo": 100820210006,"Title": "Database System Concepts","Edition": "Seventh","Author": "Abraham Silberschatz","YearOfPublication": "2021","Publisher": "McGraw Hill","Pages": 1000,"Category": "DBMS","Price": 900	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279505","AccessionNo": 181020200007,"Title": "python programming","Edition": "Seventh","Author": "Tony F Charles","YearOfPublication": "2020","Publisher": "Tony F Charles","Pages": 330,"Category": "Python","Price": 1725	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279508","AccessionNo": 101220160008,"Title": "Head First Python: A Brain-Friendly Guide","Edition": "Second","Author": "Paul Barry","YearOfPublication": "2016","Publisher": "O'REILLY","Pages": 624,"Category": "Python","Price": 1275	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279509","AccessionNo": 290920160006,"Title": "Effective Java","Edition": "Second","Author": "Joshua Bloch","YearOfPublication": "2016","Publisher": "","Pages": 264,"Category": "Java","Price": 344	},	{"ISBN": "9781593279510","AccessionNo": 101220200010,"Title": "Java The Complete Reference","Edition": "Eleventh","Author": "Herbert Schildt","YearOfPublication": "2020","Publisher": "McGraw Hill","Pages": 924,"Category": "Java","Price": 1248	}])
This will insert 10 records into Books collection.

10. Install pymongo by running python3 -m pip install 'pymongo[srv]'
11. Install mysql database on local machine, by default root user won't have any password and it can be connected from localhost.
12. Create the database LibraryDB in mysql.
13. Run the script solution-q1.py by the command python solution-q1.py
14. Switch to LibraryDB in mysql and run the query select Edition,price,Title from Books;
15. There should be rows corresponding to mongo entries and columns corresponding to attributes. The entries with title 'TestPython1' and 'TestPython2' are the ones dynamically inserted into mongo by the program after the data is exported. These entries are now visible in mysql since the callback function was watching the inserts happening on mongo and then it inserted those records to mysql via the shell script insert.sh.
